"Could you make a thing that plays a random montuno, then does a random percussion hit, and then starts again every 4 bars?" - Harry Angus

I thought about that for a few weeks, and then figured out how to do it. The first step was learning how montunos work. You know what they say: "Don't expect to teach a computer how to play a montuno if you can't play one yourself."

Every four bars it picks a new tempo, new key, and new chord progression. After two bars a random drums/percussion unison hit comes in, and then the beat never drops and we start again. Don't expect any closure. The chords come up on screen if you want to play along.
